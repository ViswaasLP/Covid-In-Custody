                    <p class="article__description-copy">In February of this year Fresno County Jail (FCJ) made <a
                        href="https://abc30.com/fresno-county-jail-coronavirus-covid/10229684/">national headlines</a>.
                      As
                      of February 1, nearly eleven months into the pandemic, the jail had reported more COVID-19
                      infections than any correctional facility in the nation.<br /><br />Jail officials attempted to
                      explain the number of infections, which totaled 3,814, by highlighting rigorous testing at the
                      facility. “We’ve been really aggressive with our testing at the Fresno County Jail,” stated Fresno
                      County Sheriff Margaret Mims.<br /><br />However, for observers monitoring COVID-19 data in
                      California’s prisons and jails, this was news. For months FCJ had scarcely reported any numbers to
                      the media or state agencies. This lack of transparency was concerning and cast doubt on how the
                      institution was handling the pandemic. <br /><br />Accurate data is a valuable tool in fighting
                      the
                      pandemic when the consequences can be deadly. As of January 2021, FCJ is the only county jail in
                      Northern California that has reported a COVID-related death. </p>

                      Driven”</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">According to Fresno County Public Defender Elizabeth Diaz, the
                    Sheriff’s Office provides her office with information about COVID-19 cases at FCJ, however only when
                    prompted. “We ask the question and we get the answers. It’s not necessarily forthcoming,” <a
                      href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11835340/why-a-massive-covid-19-outbreak-at-fresno-county-jail-flew-under-the-radar">explained
                      Diaz to KQED</a> last August.<br /><br />For the Covid In-Custody Project and other observers,
                    access to regular data has been a struggle throughout the pandemic. <br /><br />Fresno County
                    Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Tony Botti was blunt when explaining why data was not
                    forthcoming. “It stirs up hysteria when things become so data driven.” wrote Botti in a <a
                      href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11835340/why-a-massive-covid-19-outbreak-at-fresno-county-jail-flew-under-the-radar">July
                      21 memo</a>. <br /><br />This contrasts dramatically with the <a
                      href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/pr%E2%80%A6">advice of medical professionals</a> and
                    public health experts. According to Dr. Brie Williams, Professor of Medicine at the University of
                    California San Francisco, “Without accurate, timely and comprehensive data about the impact of
                    COVID-19 in prisons, we are at an extraordinary disadvantage in the fight to keep people who live or
                    work in prisons and their surrounding communities safe from the pandemic.” <br /><br />Unlike
                    California’s prisons, which are all overseen by the California Department of Corrections (CDCR),
                    California’s jails are run by the Sheriff’s Office of the county in which they reside. Data
                    reporting
                    is at the discretion of the local Sheriff— there is no statewide mandate for Sheriff’s Offices to
                    report cases, testing, vaccination rates, etc. for their jails.<br /><br />While the California
                    Department of Public Health (CDPH) collects information from the counties through the California
                    Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE), they <a
                      href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article244252932.html">do not publish it because it
                      is
                      unreliable and incomplete</a>.<br /><br />In July 2020, the Board of State and Community
                    Corrections
                    (BSCC) made an <a
                      href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6989449-COVID-19-Data-Dashboard-BSCC-7-15-2020.html">urgent
                      request</a> to the Sheriffs and Chief Probation Officers to provide facility level COVID-19 data
                    directly to them. While some Sheriffs chose to honor BSCC’s request, many did not. Often the data
                    that
                    is provided is incomplete, erroneous and obscures the answer to a simple question like, “How many
                    cases have been identified during the pandemic?”<br /><br />Despite not having any data reporting
                    requirements, several Bay Area counties have taken it upon themselves to be transparent. Since March
                    2020, Alameda County has published daily reports on the number of COVID-19 tests administered,
                    positive cases as well as the number of people incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.<br /><br />Both San
                    Francisco and Santa Clara counties have followed suit and share regular data with the public through
                    the county website.<br /><br />Clearly, when there is a desire to make data available to the public,
                    jails are able to do so. As Dr. Williams stated, data is vital to not only understanding the spread
                    of
                    the virus in the facility, but also in the surrounding community and developing public health
                    interventions.<br /><br />To mitigate the impact of the virus, most county jails instituted some
                    measures to reduce the jail population. In Fresno and other counties, zero bail and cite and release
                    policies were enacted. <br /><br />While some counties recorded a dip in the jail population during
                    Spring and Summer of 2020 due to these policies, their effect in Fresno County is unknown; The
                    Fresno
                    County Sheriff’s Office did not report its population for this period. <br /><br />In fact, since
                    Fresno began reporting its population numbers the incarcerated population has only risen. In its
                    first
                    report to the BSCC on August 1, 2020, the total jail population was 2,055. As of July 15, there are
                    2,754 people in custody.</p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">The BSCC Data</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">On July 27, 2020, the BSCC began publishing COVID-19 jail data on
                    its website. <br /><br />In addition to data reporting being voluntary, the BSCC also has no way to
                    verify the validity or correctness of the reported numbers. In <a
                      href="http://www.bscc.ca.gov/covid-19-data-dashboard-landing-page/">their own words</a>, “we rely
                    on
                    the counties to provide accurate data as the BSCC does not have audit authority.<br /><br />”Fresno
                    County’s data reported to the BSCC has been incomplete, unnecessarily vague and lacks key data
                    points.
                    There is no data reported for the number of people quarantine, active cases, or any vaccination
                    data.
                    <br /><br />If the number of confirmed cases is less than 11 for a reporting period, the exact
                    number
                    is not reported at all, it is simply acknowledged that there are active cases at the facility. The
                    BSCC states that this is in accordance with public health de-identification guidelines in order to
                    protect the identity of those tested. <br /><br />However, this makes the data unusable for
                    statistical purposes. “Since the actual values are not available, data across counties cannot be
                    summed to obtain statewide totals. Similarly, cumulative totals within a country are not
                    calculated,”
                    the BSCC stated in their “<a
                      href="http://www.bscc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Data-Reporting-Guide-Adult-Detention-Facilities-1.pdf">COVID-19

                    Project has used this data to obtain a rough estimate of COVID-19 cases in Fresno County’s jails, it
                    is incomplete. Furthermore, the data does not cover several of the most deadly months of the
                    pandemic.<br /> <br />When the Fresno Sheriff’s Office began reporting numbers to the BSCC on July
                    27,
                    2020, the jails were already in the midst of an outbreak that had begun in June, when a large group
                    of
                    transfers to CDCR were found to be positive for COVID-19.<br /><br />On July 20, 2020 Fresno <a
                      href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/coronavirus/article244346747.html">Sheriff Margaret Mims told
                      <em>The Fresno Bee</em></a> that as of the previous Friday, July 17, there had been 764 positive
                    COVID-19 cases at the facility, over 40 of which were correctional officers.<br /><br />According to
                    one person incarcerated at the jail, the virus was spreading throughout the facility long before
                    Mims
                    statement to the media. His entire 72-man pod was placed under quarantine on June 6. “My entire pod
                    had it on the first quarantine…They left everyone there because they came and swabbed us all and we
                    all tested positive.” he explained.<br /><br />They would remain under quarantine for the next 39

                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">BSCC’s Missing Data</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">Without concrete data from FCJ for the worst months of the
                    pandemic, the Covid In-Custody Project, has had to rely on statements made by jail officials to
                    media
                    outlets during June and July to estimate the extent of the outbreak. However, once the jail began
                    reporting to the BSCC the data had glaring holes and inaccuracies.<br /><br />Some weeks FCJ
                    reported
                    no data to the BSCC at all. These include:<br />September 6 – 12, 2020<br />December 27, 2020 –
                    January 3, 2021 (missing number of positive tests)<br />June 6 – 12, 2021<br /><br />The absence of
                    data for these weeks is disconcerting particularly because they occur during massive outbreaks at
                    the
                    facility.<br /><br />For the missing week in September, during the previous week, 45 out of the 132
                    tests administered had come back positive. The week after, September 13 – 19, there were no positive
                    test results out of 522 tests administered.<br /><br />The missing week which stretches from Dec.
                    2020
                    to Jan. 2021 is also disconcerting. This was in the middle of the most severe, and deadly, outbreak
                    in
                    the jail since the summer. Between December 20 – 26, there were 79 positive tests. The week after
                    the
                    missing data, on January 10, FCJ reported 33 positive tests.<br /><br />Even more alarming, that
                    week
                    is when the jail reported a death at the facility due to COVID-complications. An email exchange with
                    Botti confirmed that one individual had died but was evasive when pressed for details. “He was
                    hospitalized and passed away during his stay.” explained the Officer.<br /><br />Any follow-up
                    questions regarding the dates of his incarceration, the dates he tested positive, or procedures
                    surrounding hospitalization were ignored. Botti claimed that to divulge such information would be a
                    violation of HIPAA laws. He advised filing an additional PRA request where the Sheriff’s Office
                    would
                    determine what information would need to be redacted.<br /><br />While COVID-related deaths have
                    occurred in jails in Los Angeles and Orange counties, the death reported on January 10 at FCJ is the
                    only such instance at a facility in Northern California. Given the lack of transparency around
                    COVID-19 data at the jail, the reticence of officials to explain the circumstances is not
                    surprising,
                    however it should be a cause for alarm. </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Extreme Variations in Testing</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">In the data Fresno County has reported to the BSCC, there are
                    extreme variations in weekly testing rates which casts doubt on the efficacy of the testing
                    protocol.
                    <br /><br />For example, between August 30 – September 5, out of 132 tests administered, 45 came
                    back
                    positive. Two weeks later, the number of tests administered shot up to 522, but none were
                    positive.<br /><br />It seems unlikely that within a week FCJ could go from having 34 percent test
                    positivity rate, to not having a single positive test result. <br /><br />Particularly in the early
                    weeks of data reporting, the number of tests administered showed no consistency. For example in
                    August
                    2020, 114 tests were administered in a week and 721 in the next. Only in early 2021 did the testing
                    rate stabilize to a consistent 300-400 tests per week. <br /><br />Strangely in the midst of
                    outbreaks, the number of tests administered has tended to fall. In the first week of December, FCJ
                    reported less than 11 positive results out of 505 tests administered. By Chritmas, when the outbreak
                    peaked, the jail had only administered 222 tests of which 79 came back positive.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Discrepancies Between BSCC Data and Media
                      Reports</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">In several instances, the data reported by the Sheriff’s Office
                    to
                    the media and the BSCC do not align.<br /><br />On September 24, 2020 Botti stated in an email to
                    the
                    Covid In-Custody Project that there had been a total of 3,921 tests administered at the facility
                    since
                    March 2020. However, the sum of testing data reported to the BSCC and obtained via data requests, it
                    appears that as of September 19, 2020, only 4,186 tests were administered.<br /><br />Similarly, on
                    <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article248981650.html">January 12 in a statement to
                      <em>The New York Times</em></a>, Botti claimed the jail had 3,814 cases since the start of the
                    pandemic and had administered an astonishing 34,000 tests. The sum of testing data reported to the
                    BSCC shows that no more than 10,000 total were administered. The total number of positive test
                    results
                    by our estimate was 1,589.<br /><br />Sheriff Mims, attempted to <a
                      href="http://bscc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Fresno-County-Letter.pdf">address these
                      discrepancies</a> after activist groups questioned the accuracy of the data FCJ was reporting to
                    the
                    BSCC. Mims claimed that although there were 3,814 positive test results in FCJ since the start of
                    the
                    pandemic, it does not equal the number of positive cases, since some individuals tested positive
                    numerous times.<br /><br />“During the beginning stages of the pandemic, once an inmate tested
                    positive for COVID-19, the inmate was placed in quarantine housing. Inmates remained in quarantine
                    housing until they had a subsequent negative covid test.” explained the Sheriff. “This resulted in
                    inmates testing positive for a second and third time…It was relatively unknown at the time, but an
                    inmate may continue to test positive for months, while no longer being contagious.”
                    <br /><br />According to Mims, the actual number of unique cases at FCJ between March 3, 2020, the
                    date of the first case in the facility, and March 1, 2021 was 1,365. <br /><br />While it is not
                    unreasonable to conclude that the amount of positive test results does not equal the number of cases
                    due to double testing, the Sheriff’s Office has provided no evidence as to how they arrived at the
                    total of 1,365 cases. <br /><br />FCJ has provided no rationale as to how they have administered
                    34,000 tests when the calculation shows that no more than 10,000 were given.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Public Records Request</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">When the numbers reported by the Fresno Sheriff’s Office to the
                    BSCC appeared to be incomplete and inaccurate, the Covid In-Custody Project requested data from the
                    jail under a Public Records Act (PRA) request.<br /><br />Under state law, government institutions
                    must supply interested parties with publicly available records upon request.A request was filed on
                    January 4, 2021 to obtain data from the jail. The Covid In-Custody was met with reactions ranging
                    from
                    hostility to indifference from jail officials. While we requested ongoing updates on data coming
                    from
                    the jail, we were told each new week of testing would require a new PRA
                    request.<br /><br />According
                    to the PRA law, once a request is filed the institution in question has 10 days to respond and
                    confirm
                    if the documents are available. Then, <a
                      href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/about-cpuc/transparency-and-reporting/public-records-act-requests">according
                      to the California Public Utilities Commission</a>, the request should be fulfilled in a “timely
                    fashion.” Fresno County Jail did not fulfill its records request till May, a full five months after
                    the data was first requested.<br /><br />The data finally received were swab reports, which is the
                    raw
                    data the jail uses to report to the BSCC. The data is broken down by the three different buildings
                    at
                    the facility, and then subdivided into floors, and then each individual pod. There are five floors
                    in
                    the Main Jail, four in the North Jail, three in the South Jail, as well as the intake facility.
                    <br /><br />Each week the data is reported and the totals are broken down by the number of tests
                    administered in a pod within the jail, those administered at intake, as well as the overall total.
                    <br /><br />The swab reports also include one data point not reported to BSCC; the number of
                    refusals
                    to take a COVID test. <br /><br />Other data from the PRA request, such as, such as vaccination data
                    for the staff and incarcerated population, the number of people currently under quarantine, and the
                    number of active cases, was never supplied by the authorities. The request was simply ignored
                    despite
                    multiple follow-ups.<br />
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Incomplete Swab Data</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">The data received had many holes and only covered the months of
                    September 2020 through January 2021. Any hope that the data would shed light on testing in FCJ prior
                    to reporting to BSCC began, particularly during the worst outbreak in July, was dashed.
                    <br /><br />The data also had a two week gap at the end of November, at a time when the BSCC showed
                    19
                    positive tests at the facility for the week of November 15-21, and 12 positive cases for the week of
                    November 22-28. <br /><br />In other parts, data was duplicated. The same swab report from the dates
                    December 26, 2020 through January 1, 2021 was submitted on January 2 and again on January 9. Even
                    stranger is the data showed only 11 tests administered in the jail pods for that period, but 33
                    positive test results. <br /><br />While the Covid In-Custody Project had hoped the swab data would
                    fill in the blanks and supplement the BSCC data, it is too incomplete to accomplish that.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Contradictions with BSCC Data</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">Alarmingly, the data in the swab list diverged in numerous places
                    from data supplied to the BSCC. <br /><br />A swab list from September 25, 2020, showed that 459
                    tests
                    administered in the jail in one week. The data reported to the BSCC for the corresponding week lists
                    a
                    total of 84 tests. This type of under-reporting was common.<br /><br />Between November 7-13, the
                    swab
                    reports showed 19 positive cases. For the same time period, “less than 11” cases were reported to
                    the
                    BSCC. <br /><br />Other times the data reported to the BSCC seemed much more dire than that
                    contained
                    on the swab list. Between October 25 – 31 FCJ reported that 674 tests were administered in the jail
                    and 21 were positive. The swab lists for the corresponding period show only three cases for 337
                    tests.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Testing Refusals in FCJ</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">A key piece of data that the swab lists shed light on is the
                    number
                    of refusals. As noted earlier, a surge in positive cases at FCJ was often quickly followed by a drop
                    in the total tests administered. However, there is also a simultaneous increase in the number of
                    individuals refusing tests.<br /><br />For example, the screen capture above shows only nine
                    completed
                    tests and 63 refusals for a single floor of the Main Jail.<br /><br />What this makes clear is that
                    FCJ was not attempting fewer tests during outbreaks, but that incarcerated people presumably did not
                    want to take them. Across the country, COVID-19 quarantine units have been compared to solitary
                    confinement, causing many to decline testing to eliminate the chance of being
                    positive.<br /><br />Under quarantine, a 72-man pod will be unable to leave their area of the jail
                    for
                    up to or over a month. Access to amenities is curtailed. Individuals cannot see their attorneys or
                    attend court dates, resulting in longer periods of incarceration. <br /><br />“It’s like you’re
                    damned
                    if you do and damned if you don’t.” described one inmate. “You go over the speedy trial 90-day
                    deadline, I saw that happen three times to one guy. Dropped him and refiled and added
                    charges.”<br /><br />If a positive COVID test can trigger a quarantine, many decide it is in their
                    best interest not to take the test at all. </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">FCJ: Looking Back, Looking Forward</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">Without accurate data to rely on, it is impossible to understand
                    the true scope of the pandemic in California’s jails, and how best to ensure the safety of those
                    living there in future. The data supplied by FCJ is so incomplete, erratic and contradictory it is
                    impossible to draw firm conclusions from it. <br /><br />On several occasions, Jail officials have
                    acknowledged that the numbers they reported were inaccurate and misleading. For example, Mims has
                    publicly stated double-testing in the jail has been a problem and the number of unique COVID cases
                    in
                    the facility must be revised. <br /><br />While this is an acceptable goal, there is no apparent
                    methodology they are using to ensure an accurate total. The data they supplied to the Covid
                    In-Custody
                    Project certainly provides no indication. To the contrary, the totals the jail has reported differ
                    so
                    radically from their swab sheets, there seems to be some degree of guesswork used by the jail to
                    arrive at official numbers.<br /> <br />As the spread of COVID has slowed and jails are reporting
                    fewer cases, it is tempting to declare that the pandemic is over. The population in jails across the
                    state is climbing steadily and attention at many institutions has turned their attention to
                    vaccination efforts.<br /><br />Again, FCJ is behind the curve in reporting the relevant data. There
                    is currently no data available for vaccination rates at the jail. Observers must rely on media
                    reports
                    and rare public statements to get a glimpse of conditions inside the facility.<br /><br />What is
                    being reported does not look good; According to a local ABC affiliate, <a
                      href="https://abc30.com/fresno-jail-vaccine-county-jai-jail/10694725/">57% of people
                      incarcerated</a> at the jail are refusing the vaccine. <br /><br />FCJ has already seen the deadly
                    consequences of haphazard testing and reporting at the facility and made no efforts to revise or
                    improve its protocols. Should infection rates begin to rise again, that could spell danger for the

                      href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=USA">United States’ COVID-19
                      vaccination
                      rate</a> of 59.6% has been of much concern to health administrators and vulnerable community
                    members, several carceral institutions across the country have even lower rates leaving those in
                    congregated settings even more vulnerable to contracting the virus. Alameda County’s Santa Rita Jail
                    has administered over 800 vaccines to its population, however, due to the transitory nature of
                    county
                    jails, 300 of them were released, resulting in a 25% vaccination rate for those currently in
                    custody.<br /><br />These statistics are even more concerning in light of the Delta variant, which
                    is
                    known to be more virulent, contagious and deadly. <br /><br />In Santa Rita Jail, there is a
                    widespread availability of vaccines, however, the resistance to get vaccinated appears to arise
                    primarily from a distrust in the medical field. According to a survey conducted over March and April
                    —
                    the beginning of the vaccine rollout — roughly 50% of respondents felt that the vaccines had not
                    been
                    thoroughly tested by doctors or scientists. One even wrote, “It kills people.”<br /><br />To ensure
                    that anyone in custody who wants to be vaccinated is able to do so, Wellpath staff offer vaccines to
                    newly booked individuals on day 12, 13, and 14 of the mandatory intake quarantine period.
                    Incarcerated
                    people can also submit a medical request form or make a sick call if they want to get vaccinated.
                    <br /><br />With a vaccination rate of 25% for the population and 10%* for jail staff, recent data
                    on
                    COVID-19 cases and housing unit quarantines suggest that the jail is far from being out of the woods
                    with the pandemic.<br /><br />Active COVID-19 cases among jail staff and contractors surged to 16 on
                    Aug. 4 — a 90% increase overnight. A similar surge of 110% overnight occurred on August 15 for the
                    incarcerated population, leaving 21 active cases in custody, after months of declining
                    numbers.<br /><br />Several studies have shown that infections among staff are a primary vector for
                    outbreaks in incarcerated populations. In fact, an independent consultant who monitors Santa Rita
                    Jail’s COVID-19 response, identified that cases among staff triggering the jail’s largest outbreak
                    to
                    date — over 100 active cases were reported on a single day during December. A Wellpath
                    representative
                    also admitted, <a
                      href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2021/01/outbreaks-in-santa-rita-jail-directly-link-to-surge-in-staff-cases/">“contact
                      tracing revealed that the outbreak could have been linked to staff positives.”</a>
                    <br /><br />Health administrators have attempted to curb this transmission by mandating testing for
                    jail staff, but a vaccine mandate is not in sight. In March, Dr. Nicholas Moss, the Alameda County
                    health officer, ordered all Santa Rita Jail staff to get tested once every two weeks. On July 26,
                    the
                    health officer for California ordered all county jails t0 ascertain the vaccination status of their
                    staff, and ensure that unvaccinated staff are being tested weekly.<br /><br />While these are steps
                    in
                    the right direction to curtail the transmission of COVID-19, medical evidence unequivocally shows
                    that
                    testing cannot substitute vaccines in terms of protection against the virus.
                    <br /><br />Additionally,
                    the implementation of protocol is often far from the official narrative. The Sheriff’s Office failed
                    to meet the requirements of the March mandatory testing order for jail staff since the <a
                      href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2021/07/alameda-county-santa-rita-jail-staff-violate-mandatory-testing-order/">compliance
                      rate never reached 100%, and staff members were not being tested in exactly 14-day intervals</a>.
                    The statewide-mandate for weekly testing of unvaccinated jail staff is yet to be implemented — jails
                    have until August 23 to put a plan in place. <br /><br />For the incarcerated population, the test
                    acceptance rate is all the more concerning. The acceptance rate in housing units quarantined due to
                    exposure to a positive case averages to 74%. Roughly 42% of new books consent to a test during the
                    intake process.<br /><br />The refusal rate for testing offered to individuals medical
                    vulnerabilities, pod workers, and those housed in open-air dorms, averages to roughly 62%.
                    Individuals
                    awaiting release or transfers have an average refusal rate of 10%.

                      distribution plan</a> for Alameda County outlining eligibility criteria was adopted by the public

                      their first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine</a> by Dec. 18.<br /><br />When the distribution plan
                    was
                    developed, specifically as of Dec. 10, 2020, there were 33,736 total cases of COVID-19 and 525
                    deaths
                    in Alameda County. The jail had 277 total cases and no deaths during that time.<br /><br />According
                    to the plan, “… people in prisons, jails, detention centers, and similar facilities, and staff who
                    work in such settings,” were included in Phase 2. Phase 1A, however, included high-risk health
                    workers, first responders and those in long-term care facilities. This meant that medical staff who
                    worked at Santa Rita Jail were eligible.<br /><br />Mike Durbin, Health Services Administrator for

                    that they received 120 doses from the county for eligible medical staff in February. At the time, <a

                      62% of clinical staff had consented</a>.<br /><br />As of July 20, data from Wellpath shows that

                    vaccination rate has improved by 15% in 5 months. Out <a

                      216 staff members — 134 full-time and 82 part-time — roughly 77% are fully vaccinated</a>. 35
                    reported that they have chosen not to get vaccinated, and 14 refused to disclose any information on
                    their status.<br /><br />Currently, there is no prioritization framework in place — anyone who wants
                    to get vaccinated is able to do so.</p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Lack of data on vaccine acceptance among jail
                      staff</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">In Santa Clara County, only 50% of deputies accepted the vaccine
                    according to a Public Safety and Justice Committee report in early February, a “shocking and
                    disappointing statistic” according to Supervisor Wilma Chen. Unlike Santa Clara, counties like San
                    Francisco and Sacramento did not make any data on vaccine acceptance among staff publicly available
                    until months after the rollout.<br /><br />Until May, Alameda County also did not provide any
                    statistics on staff vaccinations despite multiple requests by the Covid In-Custody Project. Under
                    Phase 2 of the distribution plan, law enforcement officers in city police departments, Sheriff’s
                    Office, Probation Department, etc. were eligible to get vaccinated through clinics organized by the
                    Office of Emergency Services. Their data tracking system, however, failed to record the law
                    enforcement body and division a recipient belonged to. Consequently, no data could be compiled on
                    Sheriff’s Office staff or Santa Rita Jail staff who got vaccinated through these clinics.</p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Herd immunity among jail staff is
                      far-fetched</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">The lack of clean data did not stop jail representatives from
                    making unfounded claims about the vaccine acceptance rate.<br /><br />In March, speaking for the
                    Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, Undersheriff Richard Lucia told the Board of Supervisors that
                    roughly
                    75% of staff were willing to be vaccinated and 25% were not sure and/or would want to wait for the
                    second vaccination period. “We’re pretty confident that a very large number of deputies will get
                    vaccinated,” he assured them. Lucia also promised that the official numbers would be provided
                    soon.<br /><br />Captain Dan Brodie similarly indicated that jail staff had taken advantage of the
                    vaccine availability, leading to low case numbers among staff or contractors.<br /><br />These empty
                    statements had no basis in fact or knowledge. As of May 30, 39% of Sheriff’s Office staff are fully
                    vaccinated and 56% have received at least one dose according to the public health department. Since
                    data from the Office of Emergency Services’ vaccine clinics was not available, they matched records
                    of
                    vaccinated individuals in California’s Immunization Registry with the Sheriff’s Office roster.
                    <br /><br />While the state’s immunization registry has limitations like missing data and improper
                    identification, the biggest limitation with the data obtained is the lack of disaggregation among
                    Sheriff’s Office divisions. It does not specify how many staff under the Sheriff’s Office custody
                    division are vaccinated, and instead pools all divisions together, masking the degree of immunity
                    among jail staff who interact directly with the incarcerated population on a daily
                    basis.<br /><br />To combat this issue, the Covid In-Custody Project (a). requested the Sheriff’s
                    Office to conduct a survey to ascertain the vaccination status of staff and record the division they
                    belong to, and (b). requested Commander Sanchez and Captain Luckett-Fahimi to tally the number of
                    vaccination cards submitted by Sheriff’s Office staff to Human Resources. While an update on the
                    survey has been pending for several months, the latter request was fulfilled. <br /><br />Using the
                    Human Resources data as of August 2, among 1722 total Sheriff’s Office staff, only 456 or 26% are
                    fully vaccinated. Even more concerning is the custody division’s vaccination rate. Of the 746 staff
                    permanently assigned to SRJ — 466 sworn and the remaining civilian — only 77 or 10% are fully
                    vaccinated. There are 448 sworn staff from other duty stations that work at the jail on mandatory
                    over-time, however they are not included in the custody division vaccination rate.<br /><br />It is
                    possible that several staff members who are fully vaccinated may not have reported their status to
                    Human Resources, evidenced by the higher vaccination rate using the immunization registry data.
                    However, all staff have been urged to submit their vaccination cards and are given consistent
                    reminders, according to Captain Luckett-Fahimi.<br /><br />Despite the claims from Undersheriff
                    Lucia
                    and Captain Brodie that their staff have taken full advantage of vaccination opportunities, the
                    official data tells a different story.

                    to a Public Records Act request on jail staff vaccinations for the San Francisco County Sheriff’s
                    Office, out of the 455 sworn staff assigned to custody, 269 or 45% have self-reported as fully

                      href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Unvaccinated-Workers-In-High-Risk-Settings.aspx">Public
                      Health Officer Order</a> issued on July 26 by the California Department of Public Health states
                    that
                    current mitigation strategies such as universal masking for staff in healthcare or high-risk
                    congregate settings, are not proving to be sufficient in preventing transmission of the Delta
                    variant,
                    which is much more contagious and may cause more severe illness.<br /><br />The order requires that
                    high-risk congregate settings, including state and local correctional facilities and detention
                    centers, must verify and track the vaccine status of all workers. Additionally, the records of
                    vaccination verification must be made available, upon request, to the local health jurisdiction for
                    purposes of case investigation.<br /><br />Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated workers are also
                    required to undergo screening testing, where they must be tested at least once
                    weekly.<br /><br />Kimi
                    Watkins-Tartt, director of Alameda County’s public health department, and Captain Luckett-Fahimi
                    stated that since the July 26 order has been issued by the state, the local county public health
                    body
                    cannot enforce or monitor the implementation. The Sheriff’s Office Human Resources will be
                    responsible
                    for tracking the vaccination status of all staff members and providing a list of those who must get
                    tested weekly. “It is our expectation that the Sheriff’s Office will comply as this isn’t guidance,
                    it’s a Health Order,” Watkins-Tartt emphasized. She also stated that her office will be requesting
                    monthly reports in order to track the Sheriff’s compliance.<br /><br />While testing will reduce the
                    occurrences of transmission between staff and population, medical studies have shown that it is not
                    as
                    effective in doing so as vaccines. Mandatory testing not only provides insufficient protection, but
                    also introduces heavy financial costs. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the first bi-weekly
                    testing
                    requirement issued by the county’s health officer cost approximately $36,000 per month. The Sheriff
                    is
                    attempting to utilize the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding (CESF) grant of $1 million to
                    cover the expenditure.<br /><br />If the vaccination rate does not improve, the cost of implementing
                    the new weekly testing requirement may be double that of the first testing mandate, in which testing
                    occurred every 14 days. The expenditure could come up to anywhere from $60,000 to $70,000 per month
                    —
                    a cost that can easily be avoided if the majority of staff were vaccinated.<br /><br />Captain
                    Luckett-Fahimi was unaware of how the weekly testing requirement would be funded.</p>

                      people</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">On March 1, Wellpath, the jail’s medical provider, began
                    administering vaccinations to medically vulnerable patients. They initially offered 101 first-doses,
                    of which 79 people or 78% accepted. <br /><br />However, the vaccine acceptance rate dropped
                    significantly over the next 5 weeks. By April 5, around 1201 vaccines (first-dose Moderna and
                    Johnson
                    &amp; Johnson) were offered within a population of nearly 2200 people, of which only 412 individuals
                    or <a
                      href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2021/04/concerns-rise-as-vaccine-acceptance-drops-at-santa-rita-jail/">less
                      than 34% accepted.<br /><br />‍</a>In the month of May, Wellpath discontinued reporting the number
                    of individuals who have been offered vaccines due to potential duplicates. According to Mike Durbin,
                    duplicates arise when individuals who previously declined a vaccine request one at a later point. In
                    response, the Covid In-Custody Project argued that this data point is crucial to quantify vaccine
                    hesitancy and devise solutions to improve uptake. <br /><br />For new books, vaccines are offered on
                    days 12, 13, and 14 of their mandatory intake quarantine period. Meaning, anyone entering Santa Rita
                    Jail custody is given an opportunity to get vaccinated at the beginning of their incarceration.
                    Further, the general population can request to get vaccinated through a sick call or medical request
                    form</p>

                    developed by Alameda County’s public health department to track incarcerated people’s views on
                    COVID-19 vaccinations and testing was offered on tablets and on paper between March 23 through April
                    16. A bilingual phone line was also available for translation. <br /><br />The survey and various
                    flyers were also translated into all threshold languages.The survey was recently featured in a
                    report
                    that was prepared by the Community Assessment, Planning and Evaluation (CAPE) Unit of the Alameda
                    County Health Care Services Agency and Public Health Department.<br /><br />Out of over 2000 people
                    in
                    custody who had the opportunity to participate in the survey, only 60 submitted viable responses.
                    <br /><br />30% of respondents reported that they currently have, or have had, COVID-19. Around 35%
                    of
                    respondents reported that they received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.<br /><br />The top
                    reasons for respondents choosing to get tested for COVID-19 were for protecting their health, or
                    other
                    people.<br /><br />The most common answer for not having had a COVID-19 test was that it had not
                    been
                    offered to them.<br /><br />Similarly in regards to vaccine distribution, four people said that they
                    had not been offered a vaccine, or that they had asked and are still waiting.<br /><br />One
                    individual noted quarantine issues, stating that, “I took the test, and it didn’t matter people
                    around
                    me were still contracting the virus. We were not really quarantined as we were supposed to
                    be.”<br /><br />The second most common answer for not having had a COVID-19 test was due to lack of
                    trust. One individual responded, “I don’t trust it,” when asked.<br /><br />Among the 40
                    unvaccinated
                    respondents, 43% said they would take it as soon as possible and 18% said that they would
                    refuse.<br /><br />When respondents were asked if they believed there was enough information
                    available
                    on the vaccine to decide on taking it, 43% said that they disagreed or were not sure.<br /><br />“I
                    got the vaccine because I didn’t wanna risk coming home with covid and passing it to family,
                    friends,
                    and those that I come in contact with,” one respondent said after being asked why they would take
                    the
                    vaccine.<br /><br />After being asked why they would not take the vaccine, one respondent said that,
                    “they ask us if we want the shot, they don’t tell us which manufacturer they have, until we agree to
                    get it.”

                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Improving vaccine acceptance rates</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">Currently, there have been no shortages of vaccines identified
                    since the early stages of vaccine rollouts. Vaccines are offered to the population on Tuesdays,
                    Wednesdays, and Thursdays of each week. <br /><br />In the past, in order to encourage individuals
                    to
                    take the vaccine, educational flyers were posted around the jail. Currently, the Sheriff’s Office is
                    developing a new educational flyer based on the Delta Variant, as well as vaccination data. A small
                    commissary item and a telephone gift card are being provided as incentives to those who accept
                    either
                    two doses of Moderna, or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson in order to increase vaccine acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Looking forward</strong></h4>
                  <p class="article__description-copy">Since the surge of the Delta Variant, businesses have been
                    increasingly making vaccines mandatory for employees with limited exceptions.<br /><br />Under a
                    recent mandate in San Francisco, city employees who work in the jails or other high risk congregate
                    settings are required to be vaccinated by Sept. 15. The union that represents San Francisco
                    Sheriff’s
                    deputies, however, stated that a number of their employees will either quit or retire early if they
                    are forced to get vaccinated.<br /><br />When Kimi Watkins-Tartt was asked whether a mandatory
                    vaccine
                    order could be issued for Santa Rita Jail staff, she stated that neither public health nor the
                    county
                    have determined that they will mandate vaccinations. However, as more institutions and workplaces
                    start to implement their own mandates, she would not be opposed to the idea.<br /><br />Recently,
                    the
                    Covid In Custody Project reported that federal receiver J. Clark Kelso, who oversees medical care
                    inside California’s prisons, asked a federal judge for a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination order for
                    guards and staff at the prisons given the Delta variant risk.<br /><br />“We cannot afford to be
                    lulled by the decline in infections in CDCR, which mirrored the fall in rates in the larger
                    community.” Kelso wrote to the court regarding the conditions within CDCR
                    facilities.<br /><br />Kelso
                    stated that only 42% of custody staffers in state prisons have received at least one dose of the
                    vaccine, and that overall only 53% of all staff have had one shot. Further, the report states that
                    half of all outbreaks between May and July were traced back to employees, claiming that testing as a
                    substitute for vaccination is not sufficient.<br /><br />Likewise, the risk is just as great within
                    California jails, especially since it has already been reported within Santa Rita Jail. Echoing the
                    words of federal receiver Kelso, testing cannot be used as a substitute for vaccines.</p>
