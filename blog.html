                                href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=USA">United States’ COVID-19
                                vaccination
                                rate</a> of 59.6% has been of much concern to health administrators and vulnerable
                            community members,
                            several carceral institutions across the country have even lower rates leaving those in
                            congregated settings
                            even more vulnerable to contracting the virus. Alameda County’s Santa Rita Jail has
                            administered over 800
                            vaccines to its population, however, due to the transitory nature of county jails, 300 of
                            them were
                            released, resulting in a 25% vaccination rate for those currently in
                            custody.<br /><br />These statistics
                            are even more concerning in light of the Delta variant, which is known to be more virulent,
                            contagious and
                            deadly. <br /><br />In Santa Rita Jail, there is a widespread availability of vaccines,
                            however, the
                            resistance to get vaccinated appears to arise primarily from a distrust in the medical
                            field. According to a
                            survey conducted over March and April — the beginning of the vaccine rollout — roughly 50%
                            of respondents
                            felt that the vaccines had not been thoroughly tested by doctors or scientists. One even
                            wrote, “It kills
                            people.”<br /><br />To ensure that anyone in custody who wants to be vaccinated is able to
                            do so, Wellpath
                            staff offer vaccines to newly booked individuals on day 12, 13, and 14 of the mandatory
                            intake quarantine
                            period. Incarcerated people can also submit a medical request form or make a sick call if
                            they want to get
                            vaccinated. <br /><br />With a vaccination rate of 25% for the population and 10%* for jail
                            staff, recent
                            data on COVID-19 cases and housing unit quarantines suggest that the jail is far from being
                            out of the woods
                            with the pandemic.<br /><br />Active COVID-19 cases among jail staff and contractors surged
                            to 16 on Aug. 4
                            — a 90% increase overnight. A similar surge of 110% overnight occurred on August 15 for the
                            incarcerated
                            population, leaving 21 active cases in custody, after months of declining
                            numbers.<br /><br />Several
                            studies have shown that infections among staff are a primary vector for outbreaks in
                            incarcerated
                            populations. In fact, an independent consultant who monitors Santa Rita Jail’s COVID-19
                            response, identified
                            that cases among staff triggering the jail’s largest outbreak to date — over 100 active
                            cases were reported
                            on a single day during December. A Wellpath representative also admitted, <a
                                href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2021/01/outbreaks-in-santa-rita-jail-directly-link-to-surge-in-staff-cases/">“contact
                                tracing revealed that the outbreak could have been linked to staff positives.”</a>
                            <br /><br />Health
                            administrators have attempted to curb this transmission by mandating testing for jail staff,
                            but a vaccine
                            mandate is not in sight. In March, Dr. Nicholas Moss, the Alameda County health officer,
                            ordered all Santa
                            Rita Jail staff to get tested once every two weeks. On July 26, the health officer for
                            California ordered
                            all county jails t0 ascertain the vaccination status of their staff, and ensure that
                            unvaccinated staff are
                            being tested weekly.<br /><br />While these are steps in the right direction to curtail the
                            transmission of
                            COVID-19, medical evidence unequivocally shows that testing cannot substitute vaccines in
                            terms of
                            protection against the virus. <br /><br />Additionally, the implementation of protocol is
                            often far from the
                            official narrative. The Sheriff’s Office failed to meet the requirements of the March
                            mandatory testing
                            order for jail staff since the <a
                                href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2021/07/alameda-county-santa-rita-jail-staff-violate-mandatory-testing-order/">compliance
                                rate never reached 100%, and staff members were not being tested in exactly 14-day
                                intervals</a>. The
                            statewide-mandate for weekly testing of unvaccinated jail staff is yet to be implemented —
                            jails have until
                            August 23 to put a plan in place. <br /><br />For the incarcerated population, the test
                            acceptance rate is
                            all the more concerning. The acceptance rate in housing units quarantined due to exposure to
                            a positive case
                            averages to 74%. Roughly 42% of new books consent to a test during the intake
                            process.<br /><br />The
                            refusal rate for testing offered to individuals medical vulnerabilities, pod workers, and
                            those housed in
                            open-air dorms, averages to roughly 62%. Individuals awaiting release or transfers have an
                            average refusal
                            rate of 10%.

                            developed, specifically as of Dec. 10, 2020, there were 33,736 total cases of COVID-19 and
                            525 deaths in
                            Alameda County. The jail had 277 total cases and no deaths during that
                            time.<br /><br />According to the
                            plan, “… people in prisons, jails, detention centers, and similar facilities, and staff who

                                staff</strong></h4>
                        <p>In Santa Clara County, only 50% of deputies accepted the vaccine according to a Public Safety
                            and Justice
                            Committee report in early February, a “shocking and disappointing statistic” according to
                            Supervisor Wilma
                            Chen. Unlike Santa Clara, counties like San Francisco and Sacramento did not make any data
                            on vaccine
                            acceptance among staff publicly available until months after the rollout.<br /><br />Until
                            May, Alameda
                            County also did not provide any statistics on staff vaccinations despite multiple requests
                            by the Covid
                            In-Custody Project. Under Phase 2 of the distribution plan, law enforcement officers in city
                            police
                            departments, Sheriff’s Office, Probation Department, etc. were eligible to get vaccinated
                            through clinics
                            organized by the Office of Emergency Services. Their data tracking system, however, failed
                            to record the law
                            enforcement body and division a recipient belonged to. Consequently, no data could be
                            compiled on Sheriff’s

                                far-fetched</strong></h4>
                        <p>The lack of clean data did not stop jail representatives from making unfounded claims about
                            the vaccine
                            acceptance rate.<br /><br />In March, speaking for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office,
                            Undersheriff Richard
                            Lucia told the Board of Supervisors that roughly 75% of staff were willing to be vaccinated
                            and 25% were not
                            sure and/or would want to wait for the second vaccination period. “We’re pretty confident
                            that a very large
                            number of deputies will get vaccinated,” he assured them. Lucia also promised that the
                            official numbers
                            would be provided soon.<br /><br />Captain Dan Brodie similarly indicated that jail staff
                            had taken
                            advantage of the vaccine availability, leading to low case numbers among staff or
                            contractors.<br /><br />These empty statements had no basis in fact or knowledge. As of May
                            30, 39% of
                            Sheriff’s Office staff are fully vaccinated and 56% have received at least one dose
                            according to the public
                            health department. Since data from the Office of Emergency Services’ vaccine clinics was not
                            available, they
                            matched records of vaccinated individuals in California’s Immunization Registry with the
                            Sheriff’s Office
                            roster. <br /><br />While the state’s immunization registry has limitations like missing
                            data and improper
                            identification, the biggest limitation with the data obtained is the lack of disaggregation
                            among Sheriff’s
                            Office divisions. It does not specify how many staff under the Sheriff’s Office custody
                            division are
                            vaccinated, and instead pools all divisions together, masking the degree of immunity among
                            jail staff who
                            interact directly with the incarcerated population on a daily basis.<br /><br />To combat
                            this issue, the
                            Covid In-Custody Project (a). requested the Sheriff’s Office to conduct a survey to
                            ascertain the
                            vaccination status of staff and record the division they belong to, and (b). requested
                            Commander Sanchez and
                            Captain Luckett-Fahimi to tally the number of vaccination cards submitted by Sheriff’s
                            Office staff to Human
                            Resources. While an update on the survey has been pending for several months, the latter
                            request was
                            fulfilled. <br /><br />Using the Human Resources data as of August 2, among 1722 total
                            Sheriff’s Office
                            staff, only 456 or 26% are fully vaccinated. Even more concerning is the custody division’s
                            vaccination
                            rate. Of the 746 staff permanently assigned to SRJ — 466 sworn and the remaining civilian —
                            only 77 or 10%
                            are fully vaccinated. There are 448 sworn staff from other duty stations that work at the
                            jail on mandatory
                            over-time, however they are not included in the custody division vaccination
                            rate.<br /><br />It is possible
                            that several staff members who are fully vaccinated may not have reported their status to
                            Human Resources,
                            evidenced by the higher vaccination rate using the immunization registry data. However, all
                            staff have been
                            urged to submit their vaccination cards and are given consistent reminders, according to
                            Captain
                            Luckett-Fahimi.<br /><br />Despite the claims from Undersheriff Lucia and Captain Brodie
                            that their staff
                            have taken full advantage of vaccination opportunities, the official data tells a different
                            story.</p>

                            current mitigation strategies such as universal masking for staff in healthcare or high-risk
                            congregate

                            settings, including state and local correctional facilities and detention centers, must

                            vaccine status of all workers. Additionally, the records of vaccination verification must be
                            made available,
                            upon request, to the local health jurisdiction for purposes of case

                            and Captain Luckett-Fahimi stated that since the July 26 order has been issued by the state,
                            the local
                            county public health body cannot enforce or monitor the implementation. The Sheriff’s Office
                            Human Resources
                            will be responsible for tracking the vaccination status of all staff members and providing a
                            list of those
                            who must get tested weekly. “It is our expectation that the Sheriff’s Office will comply as
                            this isn’t
                            guidance, it’s a Health Order,” Watkins-Tartt emphasized. She also stated that her office
                            will be requesting
                            monthly reports in order to track the Sheriff’s compliance.<br /><br />While testing will
                            reduce the
                            occurrences of transmission between staff and population, medical studies have shown that it
                            is not as
                            effective in doing so as vaccines. Mandatory testing not only provides insufficient
                            protection, but also
                            introduces heavy financial costs. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the first bi-weekly
                            testing requirement
                            issued by the county’s health officer cost approximately $36,000 per month. The Sheriff is
                            attempting to
                            utilize the Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding (CESF) grant of $1 million to cover
                            the
                            expenditure.<br /><br />If the vaccination rate does not improve, the cost of implementing
                            the new weekly
                            testing requirement may be double that of the first testing mandate, in which testing
                            occurred every 14
                            days. The expenditure could come up to anywhere from $60,000 to $70,000 per month — a cost
                            that can easily
                            be avoided if the majority of staff were vaccinated.<br /><br />Captain Luckett-Fahimi was
                            unaware of how
                            the weekly testing requirement would be funded.</p>

                            the vaccine acceptance rate dropped significantly over the next 5 weeks. By April 5, around

                            response, the
                            Covid In-Custody Project argued that this data point is crucial to quantify vaccine
                            hesitancy and devise
                            solutions to improve uptake. <br /><br />For new books, vaccines are offered on days 12, 13,
                            and 14 of their
                            mandatory intake quarantine period. Meaning, anyone entering Santa Rita Jail custody is
                            given an opportunity
                            to get vaccinated at the beginning of their incarceration. Further, the general population
                            can request to
                            get vaccinated through a sick call or medical request form
                        </p>

                                distrust</strong></h4>
                        <p>A <a
                                href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2021/02/only-thirty-two-percent-of-santa-rita-jail-staff-accepted-testing-in-january/">survey</a>
                            developed by Alameda County’s public health department to track incarcerated people’s views
                            on COVID-19
                            vaccinations and testing was offered on tablets and on paper between March 23 through April
                            16. A bilingual
                            phone line was also available for translation. <br /><br />The survey and various flyers
                            were also
                            translated into all threshold languages.The survey was recently featured in a report that
                            was prepared by
                            the Community Assessment, Planning and Evaluation (CAPE) Unit of the Alameda County Health
                            Care Services
                            Agency and Public Health Department.<br /><br />Out of over 2000 people in custody who had
                            the opportunity
                            to participate in the survey, only 60 submitted viable responses. <br /><br />30% of
                            respondents reported
                            that they currently have, or have had, COVID-19. Around 35% of respondents reported that
                            they received at
                            least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.<br /><br />The top reasons for respondents choosing to
                            get tested for
                            COVID-19 were for protecting their health, or other people.<br /><br />The most common
                            answer for not having
                            had a COVID-19 test was that it had not been offered to them.<br /><br />Similarly in
                            regards to vaccine
                            distribution, four people said that they had not been offered a vaccine, or that they had
                            asked and are
                            still waiting.<br /><br />One individual noted quarantine issues, stating that, “I took the
                            test, and it
                            didn’t matter people around me were still contracting the virus. We were not really
                            quarantined as we were
                            supposed to be.”<br /><br />The second most common answer for not having had a COVID-19 test
                            was due to lack
                            of trust. One individual responded, “I don’t trust it,” when asked.<br /><br />Among the 40
                            unvaccinated
                            respondents, 43% said they would take it as soon as possible and 18% said that they would
                            refuse.<br /><br />When respondents were asked if they believed there was enough information
                            available on
                            the vaccine to decide on taking it, 43% said that they disagreed or were not
                            sure.<br /><br />“I got the
                            vaccine because I didn’t wanna risk coming home with covid and passing it to family,
                            friends, and those that
                            I come in contact with,” one respondent said after being asked why they would take the
                            vaccine.<br /><br />After being asked why they would not take the vaccine, one respondent
                            said that, “they
                            ask us if we want the shot, they don’t tell us which manufacturer they have, until we agree
                            to get it.”</p>
                        <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Improving vaccine acceptance rates</strong>
                        </h4>
                        <p>Currently, there have been no shortages of vaccines identified since the early stages of
                            vaccine rollouts.
                            Vaccines are offered to the population on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays of each week.
                            <br /><br />In
                            the past, in order to encourage individuals to take the vaccine, educational flyers were
                            posted around the
                            jail. Currently, the Sheriff’s Office is developing a new educational flyer based on the
                            Delta Variant, as
                            well as vaccination data. A small commissary item and a telephone gift card are being
                            provided as incentives
                            to those who accept either two doses of Moderna, or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson in
                            order to increase
                            vaccine acceptance.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="heading-36"><strong class="bold-text-5">Looking forward</strong></h4>
                        <p>Since the surge of the Delta Variant, businesses have been increasingly making vaccines
                            mandatory for
                            employees with limited exceptions.<br /><br />Under a recent mandate in San Francisco, city
                            employees who
                            work in the jails or other high risk congregate settings are required to be vaccinated by
                            Sept. 15. The
                            union that represents San Francisco Sheriff’s deputies, however, stated that a number of
                            their employees
                            will either quit or retire early if they are forced to get vaccinated.<br /><br />When Kimi
                            Watkins-Tartt
                            was asked whether a mandatory vaccine order could be issued for Santa Rita Jail staff, she
                            stated that
                            neither public health nor the county have determined that they will mandate vaccinations.
                            However, as more
                            institutions and workplaces start to implement their own mandates, she would not be opposed
                            to the
                            idea.<br /><br />Recently, the Covid In Custody Project reported that federal receiver J.
                            Clark Kelso, who
                            oversees medical care inside California’s prisons, asked a federal judge for a mandatory
                            COVID-19
                            vaccination order for guards and staff at the prisons given the Delta variant
                            risk.<br /><br />“We cannot
                            afford to be lulled by the decline in infections in CDCR, which mirrored the fall in rates
                            in the larger
                            community.” Kelso wrote to the court regarding the conditions within CDCR
                            facilities.<br /><br />Kelso
                            stated that only 42% of custody staffers in state prisons have received at least one dose of
                            the vaccine,
                            and that overall only 53% of all staff have had one shot. Further, the report states that
                            half of all
                            outbreaks between May and July were traced back to employees, claiming that testing as a
                            substitute for
                            vaccination is not sufficient.<br /><br />Likewise, the risk is just as great within
                            California jails,
                            especially since it has already been reported within Santa Rita Jail. Echoing the words of
                            federal receiver
                            Kelso, testing cannot be used as a substitute for vaccines.</p>
